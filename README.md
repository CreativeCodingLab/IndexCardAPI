# REACH Index Card API Server

This is a [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) API providing access to a database of Mitre Index Cards that are output by the [REACH system](https://github.com/clulab/reach) along with their associated publications.

Available API methods can be seen here:
[http://ccrg-data.evl.uic.edu/index-cards/explorer](http://ccrg-data.evl.uic.edu/index-cards/explorer)

## Example queries

 - Given an Index Card ObjectID, get the NXML data for that card:  
http://ccrg-data.evl.uic.edu/index-cards/api/IndexCards/56cb6ca9fb34904d10525cd3/nxml

- Given a PubMed ID, get all the Index Cards that were produced from that publication:  
http://ccrg-data.evl.uic.edu/index-cards/api/NXML/PMC1174968/indexCards

The API will also compare two Index Cards (sent via a POST request) using the [PathwayCommons IndexCardComparator script](https://github.com/PathwayCommons/pathway-cards/blob/master/comparator/src/main/scripts/IndexCardComparator.js).

## To-Do

- [ ] Incorporate "sets" of cards via a `CardSet` object.
- [ ] Figure out how to account for index cards being output by different versions of REACH.
- [ ] Give `participants` their own object, and add relations between index cards and participants.

## Notes

Original Mitre Index Cards are stored as the `mitreCard` property of an `IndexCard` object. This is to avoid mutating the original index card, with one exception â€“ if the original index card had an `_id` field, it is removed when it is added to the database. This is done to avoid confusing `_id` fields used by other databases with the fields used by this database.

NMXL publication documents are stored (in their entirety) as a [MongoDB Binary object](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.0/api/Binary.html) in the `nxmlBinary` field. The `<front>` field of the NXML document is transformed into `JSON` using [xmltojson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmltojson) and stored in the `article-front` property. 

## Object Schemas

### IndexCard

```js
{
    mitreCard: {
      description: "The original Index Card data which is output by REACH",
      type: Object,
      required: true
    },
    nxmlId: {
      description: "The foreign key for the NXML publication that generated this index card.",
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  }
```

### NXML

```js
{
  articleFront: {
    description: "The <front> field of the NXML document as output by xmltojson.",
    type: Object,
    required: true
  },
  xmlBinary: {
    description: "The entire NXML document, stored as a BSON Binary object.",
    type: Object,
    required: true
  }
}
```
